<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
Ph.D., Computer Science (in progress) <br />
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
</p>

<p>
S.M., Computer Science <br />
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June 2018 <br />
GPA: 5.0/5.0
</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
Graduate research is focused on computational genomics and, in particular, on developing fast, accurate and easy-to-use algorithms and software for processing the ever-increasing genomic data that is being produced. Focused primarily on third-generation sequencing data, and applications pertaining to it like sequence alignment and genotyping. Most recent project is developing a domain-specific language for writing computational genomics applications, which has required also delving into the field of compilers.
