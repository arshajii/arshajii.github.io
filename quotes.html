<p>Below is a collection of memorable quotes I have come across.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>&quot;If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple... but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.&quot;</em> &ndash; <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong></p>

<br>

<p><em>&quot;Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.&quot;</em> &ndash; <strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong></p>

<br>

<p><em>&quot;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?&quot;</em> &ndash; <strong>Epicurus</strong></p>
